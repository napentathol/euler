Problem 019

Counting Sundays:

I solved this problem in the browser due to a power outage.

The problem essentially boiled down to calculating the number of sundays in a year based on what day of the week it began with.

If a normal year began on a ... it had ... months begin on a Sunday, and advanced the day of the week by one day.
* Sunday: 2
* Monday: 1
* Tuesday: 1
* Wednesday: 3
* Thurday: 1
* Friday: 2
* Saturday: 2

If a leap year began on a ... it had ... months begin on a Sunday, and advanced the day of the week by two days.
* Sunday: 3
* Monday: 1
* Tuesday: 1
* Wednesday: 2
* Thurday: 2
* Friday: 1
* Saturday: 2

Since 1900 began on a Monday, and was a normal year, 1901 began on a Tuesday. This is all the information that is necessary to solve this problem.
